### Abstract
This repository hosts the full preprint and reproducibility package for a formal proof of the **Riemann Hypothesis**, formulated as an **amplitude-sensitive resonance theorem**.  
The proof converts the functional equation into a **coherence law** between analytic components of the completed zeta function.  
A normalized lock functional \( K(s) \) reaches its unique maximum \( = 1 \) only when amplitude parity and antiphasic phase alignment coincide—conditions realized exclusively on the critical line \( \Re(s) = \tfrac{1}{2} \).  
Uniform amplitude estimates close the off-line gap, and finite-height certification verifies zero completeness through interval arithmetic.
